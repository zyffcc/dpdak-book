# DPDAK (Directly Programmable Data Analysis Kit) Tutorial

This book is a practical guide to DPDAKâ€”from installation to reproducible, end-to-end workflows (e.g., GISAXS processing, batch runs, and parameter mapping). It is written for scientists and engineers who want to turn routine data processing into reliable, automated pipelines.

```{admonition} Who is this book for?
:class: tip
- Experimentalists who need a **quick, working setup** for DPDAK.
- Users who run **batch processing** on large datasets.
- New lab members who need a **guided, reproducible workflow** for scattering data analysis.
